        Elections in the Philippines are of several types. The president,
        vice-president, and the senators are elected for a six-year term, while
        the members of the House of Representatives, governors, vice-governors,
        members of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan (provincial board members),
        mayors, vice-mayors, members of the Sangguniang Panlungsod/members of
        the Sangguniang Bayan (city/municipal councilors), barangay officials,
        and the members of the Sangguniang Kabataan (youth councilors) are
        elected to serve for a three-year term.

          Every citizen 18 years old or above on Election Day who has been a
          resident of the Philippines for at least a year and for at least six
          months in the place where she or he is registered, and who is not
          otherwise disqualified by law, may vote. To actually vote, a citizen
          has to register. The COMELEC has a registration period of several
          months prior to the election. Those who are not registered do not
          appear on the voters' list and are ineligible to vote despite being
          otherwise qualified to do so.

        <p>
          Once a registered voter finds their name in the voters' list and
          locates the correct precinct, they may queue in line for the
          distribution of the ballot. Prior to the 2010 elections, voters have
          to write the names of the candidates next to the positions in which
          they are running. COMELEC-approved nicknames may be used by the voters
          in writing the names. After the polling period ends, the Board of
          Election Inspectors (or the teachers manning the polling precinct)
          counts the ballots by hand.

        <h4><center>Election Automation</center></h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          Since the 2010 elections, the voters have to shade the oval that was
          indicated before the candidate's name, and a voting machine
          manufactured by Smartmatic automatically counts each ballot as it is
          fed into it. The results are then printed as the election return and
          sent electronically to the city or municipal Board of Canvassers. In
          2016, for the third time in a row, the Philippines automated their
          elections using electronic vote counting machines.
